## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

Create the database in the terminal 
`createdb music_library`

There is the files and imports already set up. 

In their console they would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Artists
* Create and Save Albums
* Delete all Artists / Albums
* Find Artists/Albums by their ID (`select`)
* List All Artists/Albums (`select_all`)


Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist.


Remember to regularly git commit!
